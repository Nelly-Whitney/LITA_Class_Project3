#### Project Title: Analysis Of HR Data
#### Project Overview 
This report analyzes employee attritin rates within the company to identify trends, factors contributing to employee turnover, and actionable recommendations to improve retention. The analysis focuses on key demographics, performance metrics and employee satisfaction indicators.

#### Goals
### Goal of Analysis of HR Data Dataset

The primary goal of analyzing the HR Data dataset focusing on employee attrition is to gain insights into the factors that influence employee turnover within the organization. This analysis aims to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Identify Attrition Rates**: 
   - Calculate the overall attrition rate and compare it across different departments, job roles, and demographic groups.

2. **Understand Key Factors Influencing Attrition**:
   - Investigate various factors that may contribute to employee attrition, such as:
     - Employee demographics (age, gender, marital status)
     - Job characteristics (job role, salary, work environment)
     - Performance metrics (job satisfaction, performance ratings)
     - Tenure and promotion history

3. **Visualize Patterns and Trends**:
   - Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts) to illustrate trends and relationships in the data, making it easier to spot patterns related to attrition.

By achieving these goals, the analysis will help the organization better understand its workforce dynamics, identify areas for improvement, and implement strategies to enhance employee retention.

#### Data Sources
